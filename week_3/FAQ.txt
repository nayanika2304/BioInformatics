We have N = 500, L = 1000, k = 9.

Then, the combination of a 9-mer is (4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 *4) = 4^9, and how each nucleotide has a 1/4 of probability of appearing, then every 9-mer has a (1/4)^9 of probability of appearing.

In a space of 1000 nucleotides, there are (L - k + 1) different 9-mer.

So the probability to getting a specific 9-mer is: N * (L - k + 1) * (1/4)^9 = 1.89208984375

a regulatory motif is a pattern that appears at least once (perhaps with variation) in each of many different regions that are scattered throughout the genome.

Conditions
; (k,d)-motif(s) should be found in every strings (!!!) of given Dna (with d-mismatch)
  The word "EVERY" means "COMMON" element(s) in multiple strings in Dna (a string list).
; I missed this and spent lots of time.

1. d-mismatch kmers from a string in Dna
      a. Get a list of kmers from a string (string list)
      b. Get a list of d-mismatch kmers from above kmers (also string list)

2. Repeat step 1 in every strings in Dna
    Smaple input (Step 7)
       'ATTTGGC'    => first list of kmers from this string   =>  first list of d-neighbors
       'TGCCTTA'    => second list of kmers from this string   =>  second list of d-neighbors
       'CGGTATC'   => third list of kmers from this string   =>  third list of d-neighbors
       'GAAAATT'    => fourth list of kmers from this string   =>  fourth list of d-neighbors

3. Get a list of common elements from step 2 (elements existing in every d-neghbors lists above.

For the general case of tt motifs of length nn the maximum score is given by  (t − ceiling(t/4) ) ∗ n(t−ceiling(t/4))∗n

Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty of a probability distribution (p1, …, pN), and is defined as follows:

What are the maximum and minimum possible values for the entropy of a probability distribution containing four values?
ANS : The entropy of the completely conserved third column is 0, which is the minimum possible entropy. On the other hand,
a column with equally-likely nucleotides (all probabilities equal to 1/4) has maximum possible entropy −4 · 1/4 · log2(1/4) = 2.

In general, the more conserved the column, the smaller its entropy.
the entropy of a motif matrix is defined as the sum of the entropies of its columns
