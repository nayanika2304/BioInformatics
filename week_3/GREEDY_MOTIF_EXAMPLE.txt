ure!  Below is an example, and you may also like to read this blog post by our student Graeme Benstead-Hume. Consider the following matrix Dna, and let us walk through GreedyMotifSearch(Dna, 4, 5) when we select the 4-mer ACCT from the first sequence in Dna as the first 4-mer in the growing collection Motifs.

Although GreedyMotifSearch(Dna, 4, 5) will analyze all possible 4-mers from the first sequence, we limit our analysis to a single 4-mer ACCT:

                             TTACCTTAAC
                             AGGATCTGTC
                        Dna  CCGACGTTAG
                             CAGCAAGGTG
                             CACCTGAGCT

We first construct the matrix Profile(Motifs) of the chosen 4-mer ACCT:

            Motifs           A    C    C    T



                       A:    1    0    0    0

                       C:    0    1    1    0

    Profile(Motifs)    G:    0    0    0    0

                       T:    0    0    0    1

Since Pr(Pattern|Profile) = 0 for all 4-mers in the second sequence in Dna, we select its first 4-mer AGGA as the Profile-most probable 4-mer, resulting in the following matrices Motifs and Profile:


            Motifs           A    C    C    T

                             A    G    G    A



                       A:    1    0    0   1/2

                       C:    0   1/2  1/2   0

    Profile(Motifs)    G:    0   1/2  1/2   0

                       T:    0    0    0   1/2

We now compute the probabilities of every 4-mer in the third sequence in Dna based on this profile.  The only 4-mer with nonzero probability in the third sequence is ACGT, and so we add it to the growing set of 4-mers:


                             A    C    C    T

             Motifs          A    G    G    A

                             A    C    G    T



                       A:    1    0    0   1/3

                       C:    0   2/3  1/3   0

    Profile(Motifs)    G:    0   1/3  2/3   0

                       T:    0    0    0   2/3

We now compute the probabilities of every 4-mer in the fourth sequence in Dna based on this profile and find that AGGT is the most probable 4-mer:

       CAGC  AGCA  GCAA  CAAG  AAGG  AGGT  GGTG

        0   1/27    0     0     0    4/27   0

After adding AGGT to the matrix Motifs, we obtain the following motif and profile matrices:

                             A    C    C    T

             Motifs          A    G    G    A

                             A    C    G    T

                             A    G    G    T



                       A:    1    0    0   1/4

                       C:    0   2/4  1/4   0

    Profile(Motifs)    G:    0   2/4  3/4   0

                       T:    0    0    0   3/4

We now compute the probabilities of every 4-mer in the fifth sequence in Dna based on this profile and find that AGCT is the most probable 4-mer:


       CACC  ACCT  CCTG  CTGA  TGAT  GAGT  AGCT

         0   6/64    0     0     0    0    18/64

After adding AGCT to the motif matrix, we obtain the following motif matrix with consensus AGGT:

                             A    C    C    T

                             A    G    G    A

             Motifs          A    C    G    T

                             A    G    G    T

                             A    G    C    T
